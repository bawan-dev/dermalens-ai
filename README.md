# DermaLens AI — Ingredient Risk Analyzer
A full ML/NLP + Embedding-powered system for skincare ingredient analysis, similarity search & risk scoring.

This project is a Streamlit-based machine learning app that analyzes skincare ingredient lists, predicts fungal-acne safety, highlights risky ingredients, and recommends similar products using BERT embeddings.
It also supports OCR input, PDF report generation, product memory storage, and expert-mode explainability via LIME.

The classifier is designed to feel like a modern, user-friendly skincare analysis tool — while showcasing advanced ML engineering under the hood.

🚀 Key Features
🔬 ML Classification (10 classes)

TF-IDF + Logistic Regression model (10-label classifier).

Expert mode unlocks:

Probability breakdowns

LIME explanations

Interpretable feature influences

🧠 BERT Ingredient Embeddings

Uses sentence-transformers (MiniLM-L6-v2) to embed:

Ingredient lists

Individual ingredients

Full products

Supports:

Similar product recommendations

Ingredient-level nearest-neighbor insights

Per-ingredient replacements & similarity scores

🧪 Fungal Acne Risk Engine

Detects fatty acids, esters, polysorbates & known triggers.

Generates a 0–10 fungal-acne safety score.

Produces a user-friendly explanation.

💾 Product Memory 2.0

Each processed product is saved with:

Name

Ingredient list

Embeddings

Timestamp

Users can reload past analyses instantly without recomputation.

📄 PDF Export

Generate a clean report that includes:

Scores

Predictions

Breakdown

Similar product recommendations

Ingredient insights

Optional LIME figures

🖼️ OCR Image Input (Stubbed)

Upload a product label image.

OCR pipeline is stubbed for local/offline usage.

Ready for Tesseract integration.

🔍 Brand Auto-Detection (Stub)

Stub function for future web search integration.

Plug in DuckDuckGo API / scrape flow later.

🎨 Modern UI

Multi-tab interface:

Overview

Ingredients

Similar Products

Expert Mode

Ingredient chips grouped by safety categories.

Responsive, mobile-friendly layout.

🧬 Rebuilding the Embeddings

If you update data/product_memory.csv:

python src/ingredient_embeddings.py


This regenerates models/ingredient_embeddings.pt.

🧪 Running Tests
pytest


Tests cover:

Parsing

Similarity helpers

Fake prediction pipelines

OCR stub behavior
