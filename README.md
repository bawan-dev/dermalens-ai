🧴 Fungal Acne Ingredient Classifier
A 10-Class Machine Learning Model for Skincare Safety Analysis

This project is a machine learning-powered web app that:

Classifies skincare formulas into 10 ingredient categories

Evaluates fungal acne (Malassezia) safety

Provides ingredient-by-ingredient breakdowns

Includes Human Mode (simple explanations) + Expert Mode (LIME, probabilities, model confidence)

Runs completely in Streamlit

🚀 Features
🧠 Multi-Class ML Model

Trained on 1,000+ curated examples with 10 labels:

safe

neutral

malassezia_trigger

comedogenic

irritant

fragrance_heavy

fatty_acid

emollient_heavy

surfactant

preservative

🔍 Human Mode

Clear skincare explanation

Fungal acne score (0–10)

Ingredient breakdown (safe / mild / high-risk)

🧪 Expert Mode

Class probabilities

Confidence badge

LIME interpretability

Bar charts & feature weights

ML explainability for recruiters
